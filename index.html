      My Coding Journey
    </h2>

    <p>
      I was made redundant 18th December 2020, after working in my previous job for 17 years. I knew that I wanted to
      change my career.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      I wanted to do something NEW, exciting and more challenging, and I wanted something that would give me more
      opportunities within work and also home life.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      This is where my coding Journey starts. After a rocky start trying to get onto any coding course, I finally got
      onto a coding course with CodeNation.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      I have now done two courses with CodeNation, first was an introduction to coding which was three weeks long. The
      course covered Python, HTML and CSS. Within three weeks we had to complete a group project and a solo project. The
      group project was to build a python game and for the solo project we had to make a website on any hobbies or
      interests.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      The second course again with CodeNation, where Master BootCamp. This course was 12 weeks long. During the course
      we covered a range of different technologies, here are just a few: github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
      Workbench, MySQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Docker and Insomnia.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Now, I will be starting a three week Cyber Security course With CodeNation on Monday 28th February 2022, which I
      am really looking forward to, learning new skills. Also I am actively searching for My first job as a Frontend
      Developer. I currently like working with React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
